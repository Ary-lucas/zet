# Markdown is pretty cool!!

## You can customize pretty much anything in you markdown, and it will be a very easy task since the "syntax" is easy.

* You can have a little bullet like this
* multiple bullets even!!

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
  fmt.Println("Some code if you want")
}
```

Sometimes your text will need to be *italic*, sometimes **bold** or even ***both at the same time***

Markdown even got you covered if you need little snippets of `code`.

If you need to slip in a URL you would do it aways tiping the full link like this:

https://github.com/Ary-lucas

* And if you are prone to some organization you can put your references at the bottom.
