# How to make a zettel entry

This is the body of the zettel (wich meand "slip")

* First bullet
* Second bullet

But, when I have an ordered or numbered list:

1. First
2. Second

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
  fmt.Println("Hello world!")
}
```

What if I want *italic* or **bold** or ***bolditalic***?

how about something that look like `code`?

And when I have a URL I want it to print also so I always write it out like this:

https://github.com/Ary-lucas

* I put references at the bottom.
